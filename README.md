# Ephemeral Value Adjustment

This repository contains an implementation of Ephemeral Value Adjustment (EVA) from "Fast deep reinforcement learning using online adjustments from the past" by S.Hansen et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08163 </br>
Project is done as part of the course <a href="http://deeppavlov.ai">DeepPavlov </a> course: <a href="http://deeppavlov.ai/rl_course_2020"> Advanced Topics in Deep Reinforcement learning </a>. 

#### <a href="https://github.com/amfolity/">Anna Mazur</a>, <a href="https://github.com/darthrevenge">Nikita Trukhanov</a>

### Running the code
We used PyTorch library version 1.6.</br>
For performing approximate nearest neighbours search we used Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN).
Original codes and intall instructions could be found https://github.com/mariusmuja/flann.
